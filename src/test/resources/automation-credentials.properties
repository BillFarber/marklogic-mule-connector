# Keystore settings:
# First, obtain the cert file (starts with -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE---- and ends with ------END CERTIFICATE------)
# Then, generate the keystore by running the following command (replace cert-file.crt with your certificate, and keystore.jks with your keystore name):
#        keytool -import -trustcacerts -alias ml-demo -file cert-file.crt -keystore keystore.jks
# Enter a password and remember the password, then when prompted to trust the certificate, type 'y' and hit enter.
# Once the keystore has been created, drop it into src/test/resources and configure the two parameters:
# keystore.filepath=src/test/resources/keystore.jks
# keystore.password=your-password-here
