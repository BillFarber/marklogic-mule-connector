The MarkLogic MuleSoft connector supports reading data from and writing data to MarkLogic 
[in a Mule application](https://docs.mulesoft.com/connectors/introduction/introduction-to-anypoint-connectors). MuleSoft flows can leverage the full power of 
[MarkLogic's search indexes](https://docs.marklogic.com/guide/concepts/indexing) to retrieve data and can
also write any kind of data to MarkLogic's schema-agnostic databases. 

The connector has the following system requirements:

* Mule 4.1 or higher.
* MarkLogic 9 or higher.

Please see [the installation guide](installation-guide.md) to get started.
